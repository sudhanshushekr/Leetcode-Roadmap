# ðŸš€ LeetCode Systematic Roadmap

This repository contains my **systematic journey of solving LeetCode problems** following a structured roadmap.  
The goal is to strengthen **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** step by step by focusing on one topic at a time.

4. **Linked List**
5. **Trees**
   - Tries
   - Heap / Priority Queue
6. **Backtracking**
7. **Graphs**
   - Advanced Graphs
