### 2. Fast and Slow Pointers
- **Use when**: Need to detect cycles, find middle element, or work with linked lists
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) typically
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) usually
- **Examples**: Linked List Cycle, Middle of Linked List, Remove Nth Node

### 3. Sliding Window with Two Pointers
- **Use when**: Need to find subarrays with certain properties
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) typically
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) or O(k) where k is window size
- **Examples**: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

### 4. Three Pointers
- **Use when**: Need to work with three elements or arrays
- **Time Complexity**: O(n¬≤) typically
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) usually
- **Examples**: 3Sum, 4Sum, Merge Three Sorted Arrays

### 5. Merge with Two Pointers
- **Use when**: Need to merge sorted arrays or lists
- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n) typically
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) or O(m + n)
- **Examples**: Merge Sorted Array, Merge Two Sorted Lists

### 6. Partition with Two Pointers
- **Use when**: Need to partition array based on some condition
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) typically
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) usually
- **Examples**: Sort Colors, Move Zeroes, Partition List

## üöÄ Solution Template Structure

Each solution follows this structure:

```python
class Solution:
    def problem_name(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Problem: [Brief description]
        
        Example:
        Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        Output: 15
        
        Approach 1: Brute Force
        Time Complexity: O(n¬≤)
        Space Complexity: O(1)
        """
        
        # Approach 1: Brute Force
        def brute_force_solution(nums):
            # Implementation
            pass
        
        # Approach 2: Two Pointers
        def two_pointers_solution(nums):
            # Implementation
            pass
        
        # Return best solution
        return two_pointers_solution(nums)
```
